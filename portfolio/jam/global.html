	<p>In this puzzle game, save your robot brethren by using a visual scripting language to move around the map, avoid enemies, and shoot repairing lasers.</p>
	<p>This project was made during Global Game Jam 2020, on a team of 7. The theme was "Repair."</p>
	<p>My contributiions as a new Freshman were limited, but I had the following roles:</p>
	<ul>
		<li>Texture Artist, creating textures for several of the game's models</li>
		<li>Narrative Designer, helping to create the game's story</li>
	</ul>
