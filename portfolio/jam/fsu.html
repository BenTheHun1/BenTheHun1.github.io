		<li>2D Artist, I made the tileset for and constructed the level in Godot, and designed the game's logo and ending art</li>
		<li>Programmer, as I had previously developed the Untitled RPG (unreleased, but source available on GitHub) in Godot, which served as the basis for the project</li>
		<li>Maintainer, as I independently created a post-jam version, fixing many of the game's bugs.</li>
	</ul>
