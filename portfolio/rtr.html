	<p>In Rubble Town Rumble, you play as Angus the Dwarfslayer, who has traveled to Rubbletown on some non-descript journey and went a little overboard on the drinking.
	Now all the dwarves there are sober and infuriated. Kick, slash, and destroy your way through these beardy foes!</p>
	<p>RTR was made as the final project for my 3D Game Development class, on a team of 5. I was the:</p>
	<ul>
		<li>Producer, responsible for keeping everyone, and the project as a whole on track.</li>
		<li>Programmer, primarily responsible for the Player Controller and Shop</li>
		<li>Game Designer, where I created the original premise, and designed many of the game's systems.</li>
		<li>3D Modeller, for the Player's Shield</li>
		<li>UI Designer, creating the layout and functionality of the HUD, pause menu, and main menu</li>
		<li>"Git Kraker", affectionately. Made sure everyone new how to use Git, GitHub, and GitKraken, as well as managing different branches and resolving merge conflicts</li>
	</ul>

	<p>RTR was ported to VR as the final project for my Virtual Reality Development class, on a team of 2. I was the:</p>
	<ul>
		<li>Programmer, responsible for porting and recreating much of the game's systems, primarily the Player Controller, adding physics to objects and weaponry, and the shop</li>
		<li>I also provided a new "gulping" sound effect, personally.</li>
