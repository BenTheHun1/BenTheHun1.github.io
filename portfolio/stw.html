	<p>Wander around the beach and the surrounding areas, pickin up trash to raise money in support of cleaning the world's oceans.</p>
	<p>Save the World! was developed for <a href="https://bowseat.org/">Bow Seat</a>'s Ocean Awareness Art Contest. This was a solo project, so I was responsible for all aspects, excluding the ambient wave sound effects, which are public domain.</p>
