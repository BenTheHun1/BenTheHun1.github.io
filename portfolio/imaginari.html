	<p>A child's distorted journey through his house, at night.</p>
	<p>Imaginari was made as the final project for my Advanced Game Workshop class, on a team of 5, plus 2 Music & SFX members. I was the:</p>
	<ul>
		<li>Producer, responsible for keeping everyone, and the project as a whole on track.</li>
		<li>Programmer, primarily responsible for the Player Controller and Shop</li>
		<li>Game Designer, where I created the original premise, and designed many of the game's systems.</li>
	</ul>
