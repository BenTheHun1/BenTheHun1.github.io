	<h2>My Kingly Journey: Carrie (8/1-8/3)</h2>
	<p>I have begun my journey through the bibliography of Stephen King, with his first published Novel, <i>Carrie</i>. Before today, my only other exposures to king was the <i>11/22/63</i> mini-series on Hulu, and the first book of the Dark Tower series, <i>The Gunslinger</i>.</p>
	<p><i>Carrie</i> felt unadaptable. If it were to be made into a movie, which it has, I can't imagine it would be as good as the story I've read. So much of it takes place in the character's heads, as well as in after-the fact memoirs and newspaper clippings. I thought it was a really unique method of storytelling. Alas, the horror of the book only presented itself in one scene, with Carrie and her mother, towards the end of the book that I will not spoil here. For the rest of the time, my feelings were of pity, not fear. And maybe that's what we are supposed to feel, I'm not sure.</p>
	<p>It was quite a short novel, and a good introduction to Stephen King. I will begin <i>'Salem's Lot</i>.</p>

	<h2>My Kingly Journey: 'Salem's Lot (8/3-8/10)</h2>
	<p><i>'Salem's Lot</i> was quite a different story compared to Carrie. Carrie was from the perspective of just a couple people, her tormentor, her sympathizer, and Carrie, primarily.<i>'Salem's Lot</i>, by contrast, is very much about the entire town of Jerusalem's Lot. Our protagonist, Ben Mears, is quite important. But the town moves around him. In one corner, a young housewife abuses her infant child. In another, a hunchback spends his day shooting rats with his peashooter. As the book progresses, and the number of vampires increases, the story becomes increasingly centered on our main characters, Ben, Mark, Matt, Jimmy, and Father Callahn. It really makes you feel that the town is dying around you, and attempts to stop what has been started is futile.</p>
	<p>King's writing feels much more polished, his prose impressive.</p>
	<p>One interesting thought is Carrie depicted religion in a negative light, where she's bullied because of it, and her mothers extremist beliefs shape her into the monster that destroys Chamberlain. <i>'Salem's Lot</i>, by contrast, shows how religion can be a Force, with a capital F, of good, smiting evil and protecting society from the things that go bump in the night.</p>
	<p>The quality of the book is higher than I can express in writing, and I highly recommend it. Now, onto <i>The Shining</i>.</p>
