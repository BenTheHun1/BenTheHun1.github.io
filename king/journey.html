	<h2>My Kingly Journey: Carrie (8/1-8/3)</h2>
	<p>I have begun my journey through the bibliography of Stephen King, with his first published Novel, <i>Carrie</i>. Before today, my only other exposures to king was the <i>11/22/63</i> mini-series on Hulu, and the first book of the Dark Tower series, <i>The Gunslinger</i>.</p>
	<p><i>Carrie</i> felt unadaptable. If it were to be made into a movie, which it has, I can't imagine it would be as good as the story I've read. So much of it takes place in the character's heads, as well as in after-the fact memoirs and newspaper clippings. I thought it was a really unique method of storytelling. Alas, the horror of the book only presented itself in one scene, with Carrie and her mother, towards the end of the book that I will not spoil here. For the rest of the time, my feelings were of pity, not fear. And maybe that's what we are supposed to feel, I'm not sure.</p>
	<p>It was a quite a short novel, and a good introduction to Stephen King. I will begin <i>'Salem's Lot</i>.</p>
