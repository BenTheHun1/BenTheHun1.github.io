	<p>Over the years I've worked on many a project, each of which I try to keep supported and updated as much as possible.</p>
	<h2>For my newest projects, check out my <a href=https://benthehun1.itch.io/>itch.io page</a>.</h2>
	<h3>My Quarantine Life</h3>
	<p>For my Game Design Workshop class, I made a game over the course of six weeks in Fall 2020.</p>
	<p>My Quarantine Life is a game where "real-life" needs must be balanced with virtual activities in order to stay sane during a worldwide pandemic.</p>
	<p>You can download it from itch:</p>

	<h3>Elemental Exodus</h3>
	<p>From October 19th to October 30th 2020 I worked on a team of four to make a game for my college's annual Fall Game Jam</p>
	<p>Elemental Exodus features multiple levels, split up into two genres: an action-RPG and a platformer. You can download it from itch:</p>

	<h3>The Ever-Evolving Game</h3>
	<p>In Fall 2020, I started development on an incremental, idle game that would "unfold" by introducing new mini-games of other genres, that would interlock and interact with eachother (e.g. gameplay in a text-based RPG unlocks new food for your Tamagotchi-esque pet).</p>
	<p>I didn't get as much done as I would've like, as my college game design work comes first. However, I do intend to return to it at some point, or at the very least the idea of it. You can download it from itch:</p>

	<h3>Save the World!</h3>
	<p>Over a week in July 2020, I made a game for <a href="https://bowseat.org/">Bow Seat</a>'s Ocean Awareness Art Contest. You can play it in your browser on itch:</p>

	<h3>Pandemic Panic</h3>
	<p>For my final in Elements of Game Design (Spring 2020) I made a gamebook, in the vein of Choose-Your-Own-Adventure books in the past. You can download a zip with a pdf and form-fillable character sheet <a href="Pandemic Panic - The Tower.zip">here</a>.</p>
	<p>I may port the game to Twine, I don't know. If I did, I would make a large expansion to it as well.</p>
	
	<h3>reCircuit</h3>
	<p>January 31st to February 2nd 2020 I worked on a relatively small team, and we made a visual programming game for the Global Game Jam. It's available for Windows and Mac, <a href="https://globalgamejam.org/2020/games/recircuit-0">here</a>.</p>
	<h3>Who is the Enemy?</h3>
	<p>In November 2019 I worked on a small team for my college's Fall Game Jam. The theme of the Jam was "No One is the Enemy."</p>
	<p>I've polished it up and you can download it on itch below.</p>

	<h3>Advent</h3>
	<p>In late 2018 I made a small tech demo of a Myst-like adventure game made with Visual Basic, which I was learning in class at the time.</p>
	<p>In early 2019 I started making a choose-your-own-adventure game in HTML under the same name, which can be played <a href="../advent/index.html">here</a>.</p>
	<p>You can download and play the original version below.</p>
	<p><a href="https://github.com/BenTheHun1/Advent/releases">Download Latest Advent (v3.1)</a></p>
	<p>During the same period, I made an incredibly simple, kind of broken web browser also in Visual Basic.</p>
	<p>You can download it below.</p>

	<h3>RPGMaker Trilogy</h3>
	<p>In Mid 2018 I made a Trio of RPGMaker games. None of them are complete, but I hope to come back to them someday. Downloads are provided out of curiosity.</p>
	<p>Alearia: the first game I made. Very small, was meant to be a fairly generic fantasy RPG.</p>
	<p>On 5/30/20, I added a proper ending and a couple new features. It's still pretty barebones though. You can play it in your browser on itch:</p>

	<p><a href="https://drive.google.com/file/d/1zcgPySCse9LxpvRvp0Fm5IzNa_2NC3zi/view?usp=sharing">Zerron</a>: based on an idea I had when I was very young. Meant to be a big crossover game. Some more background info is available <a href="https://docs.google.com/document/d/1worJfXDoMUecFCQUXwLROqQrT0qN7JcJMJBHMeIMFYo/edit?usp=sharing">here</a>.</p>
	<p><a href="https://drive.google.com/file/d/15qrjuq1ACtoYEfCZvhW-t61iP_Tzp6sT/view?usp=sharing">Potter World</a>: the Harry Potter RPG I've always wanted. Or at least, that's what I wanted it to be.</p>
	
	<h3>Armonia</h3>
	<p>Since 2017 I've been steadily working on my fantasy tabletop RPG called Armonia. It's not currently available for distribution.</p>
	<h3>Minecraft Mod Packs</h3>
	<p>Since December 2016 I've curated and maintained a small selection of Minecraft Mod Packs, hosted on CurseForge.</p>
	<p>These are nothing crazy, but for those who do download it, I try to keep them updated with the latest versions of mods at the least.</p>
	<p><a href="https://www.curseforge.com/members/benthehun1/projects">View and Download</a></p>
	<p>It's worth noting that these work best when installed via the <a href="https://curseforge.overwolf.com/">CurseForge app</a> (built on <a href="https://www.overwolf.com/">Overwolf</a>).</p>
	
	<h3>YouTube Channel</h3>
	<p>From 2015 to 2018 I worked to become a YouTube Let's Player. If you're curious, my channel is <a href="https://www.youtube.com/user/BentheHun1">here</a>.</p>
	<p>I also was fascinated with ARGs (Alternate Reality Games) and I was learning how to use video editing software, so I made some weird videos on <a href="https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCoGuATE9PVv7U4AmUn45yRw">this</a> channel.</p>
	<p>In Early 2019 I did a Film class in High School, and all the videos I created are on <a href="https://www.youtube.com/channel/UC2en9jmEjHOmHsaf_xsQW_w">my personal channel</a>.</p>
	
	<h3>Scratch</h3>
	<p>Around 2015 I made many projects in <a href="https://scratch.mit.edu/">Scratch</a> For anyone interested, all my projects are <a href="https://scratch.mit.edu/users/benhun1/">here</a>.</p>
