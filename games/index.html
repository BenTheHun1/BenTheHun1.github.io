	<p>Over the years I've worked on many a project, each of which I try to keep supported and updated.</p>
	<h3>Who is the Enemy?</h3>
	<p>In November 2019 I worked on a small team for my college's Fall Game Jam. The theme of the Jam was "No one is the Enemy."</p>
	<p>I've polished it up and you can download it on itch below.</p>

	<h3>Advent</h3>
	<p>In late 2018 I made a small tech demo of a Myst-like adventure game made with Visual Basic, which I was learning in class at the time.</p>
	<p>In early 2019 I started making a choose-your-own-adventure game in HTML under the same name, which can be played <a href="../advent/index.html">here</a>.</p>
	<p>You can download and play the original version below.</p>

	<h3>RPGMaker Trilogy</h3>
	<p>In Mid 2018 I made a Trio of RPGMaker games. None of them are complete, but I hope to come back to them someday. Downloads are provided out of curiosity.</p>
	<p><a href="https://drive.google.com/file/d/1ch2R22h0bSrRM5OF2Gunf0zdpIHxDtL1/view?usp=sharing">Alearia</a>: the first game I made. Very small, was meant to be a fairly generic fantasy RPG.</p>
	<p><a href="https://drive.google.com/file/d/1zcgPySCse9LxpvRvp0Fm5IzNa_2NC3zi/view?usp=sharing">Zerron</a>: based on an idea I had when I was very young. Meant to be a big crossover game. Some more background info is available <a href="https://docs.google.com/document/d/1worJfXDoMUecFCQUXwLROqQrT0qN7JcJMJBHMeIMFYo/edit?usp=sharing">here</a>.</p>
	<p><a href="https://drive.google.com/file/d/15qrjuq1ACtoYEfCZvhW-t61iP_Tzp6sT/view?usp=sharing">Potter World</a>: the Harry Potter RPG I've always wanted. Or at least, that's what I wanted it to be.</p>
	
	<h3>Armonia</h3>
	<p>Since 2017 I've been steadily working on my fantasy tabletop RPG called Armonia. It's not currently available for distribution.</p>
	<h3>Minecraft Mod Packs</h3>
	<p>Since December 2016 I've curated and maintained a small selection of Minecraft Mod Packs, hosted on CurseForge.</p>
	<p>These are nothing crazy, but for those who do download it, I try to keep them updtaed with the latest versions of mods at the least.</p>

	<p>It's worth noting that these work best when installed via the <a href="https://www.twitch.tv/downloads">Twitch App</a>.</p>
	<h3>YouTube Channel</h3>
	<p>From 2015 to 2018 I worked to become a YouTube Let's Player. If you're curious, my channel is <a href="https://www.youtube.com/user/BentheHun1">here</a>.</p>
	<p>I also was fascinated with ARGs (Alternate Reality Games) and I was learning how to use video editing software, so I made some weird videos on <a href="https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCoGuATE9PVv7U4AmUn45yRw">this</a> channel.</p>
