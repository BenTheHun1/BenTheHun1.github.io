	<h2>A New Website once again.</h2>
	<p>Tuesday, March 26, 2019</p>
	<p>In the past, my website could be found at <a href="https://benhun.wixsite.com/benthehun1">benhun.wixsite.com/benthehun1<a/>.</p>
	<p>Previously, my website was <a href="https://sites.google.com/view/benthehun1">sites.google.com/view/benthehun1</a>.</p>
	<p>Now, I have my own domain and I'm creating it from scratch. It is availble here: <a href="https://www.benthehun1.tk">benthehun1.tk</a>.</p>
	<p>This blog may or may not continue to be updated.</p>

	<h2>A Husc of an idea</h2>
	<p>Friday, February 15, 2019</p>
	<p>I've been steadily working on Armonia these past few months. 
	However, I have and still do dabble in other roleplaying projects, and I had the idea to make a core game, 
	to serve as a common foundation for other projects to build off of, like an engine for a video game. 
	I came up with Hunsicker's Universal System Core, a.k.a HUSC (pronounced Husk). 
	In the future, I would open it up for others to make their own "sub games" for HUSC.</p>
